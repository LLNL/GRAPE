v1.0.4

DEVELOPER: Peter Robinson
REVIEWERS: Ben Liu, Chris White, Aaron Fisher

SUMMARY
NEW FEATURE: grape now can manage nested subprojects. These are nested repositories that are ignore by git and managed entirely by grape. 
Nested Subprojects: 
can be created using grape addSubproject --nested
can be activated using grape uv
are active (cloned, checked out, and managed by grape) only when a user activates them using grape uv. 
are ignored by git (entire directory is added to the outer level .gitignore)
have a branch structure identical to the outer repository. 
are ideal for repositories containing large binary data that you don't want clogging up your source code repository.

v1.0.3

Adds nested subprojects as a subproject type, allowing users to add grape managed repos that are ignored by git to a repository.

v1.0.2

Prevent error if missing submodule directory does not exist


Fri Oct  3 16:07:46 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.0.1

Changed the behavior of grape checkout to be aware of your submodule branching model.
Switching to a branch with a new submodule triggers a full call to grape uv, starting a dialogue asking the user which submodules she wants. 
Switching to a branch that doesn't have a submodule that was on the previous branch will now trigger a dialogue asking if that user wants to delete the submodule, so long as the submodule is in a clean state.

v0.2.1

DEVELOPER: Peter Robinson
REVIEWERS: Ben Liu, Chris White
SUMMARY: 
Adds the necessary features to enable a gitflow workflow (finally!)
Adds a BSD LICENSE file in preparation for an open source release. 
Updates grape's .grapeconfig to have publish processes for internal releases and external releases. 

DETAILS:
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

grape writeConfig : now has the --gitflow option which will tweak the resulting grapeconfig file to be configured for a gitflow workflow. 

grape bundle : now has the --bundleTags option, which enables branch specific tags to be bundled. 

grape unbundle now takes one file per branch to unbundle. 

grape publish : the --cascade option is now --cascade=<branch> - you must define which branch to cascade to when using this option. 

grape publish and grape review : now have --stashURL and --verifySSL options that enable specifying the URL of your stash repository and disabling SSL checking (not recommended unless absolutely necessary). 

grape publish --quick : now allows --noReview and --public to be used. 

grape mr : now has verbosity controls with -v and --quiet. 


GRAPE CONFIG OPTIONS
[flow] has a new config option, topicDestinationMappings. This overrides where branches are published to. If a topic branch type doesn't have a mapping here, the topicprefixmapping is still used as before to determine the public branch to publish to. 

ISSUES FIXED
Addresses GRP-67,GRP-60, GRP-30 GRP-58, GRP-63, GRP-59
grape checkout now pulls preexisting branches before updating submodules. This should help with submodules' gitlinks being in a dirty state after a fresh checkout. 

grape checkout is now more verbose by default. 

grape config now asks before enabling https credential cacheing.  (this would break Windows git configurations). 

The Tutorial has been updated to instruct new users to use the gitflow configuration by default.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES: 
Improved subtree support during publish and addSubproject. 
Allows -v and --user option for grape publish --quick
Allows db to delete the current branch when recursing into submodules. 
Improved documentation and adds a tutorial to the Readme. 
Adds grape push. 
grape checkout more robust to a mixture of branches being and not being present in submodules. 
grape publish now frontloads all user input to before the build step. 
grape --continue and grape --abort are now enforced as mutually exclusive options by the parser. 
quieting some extra output in grape uv and grape bundle.

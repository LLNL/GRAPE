v1.3.2

- Fix for deletion of nested subproject branch after publish (it is merged up to HEAD, but not pushed)

Tue Feb 10 10:34:11 2015 Peter B. Robinson
v1.2.7

SUMMARY: Adds public branch and branch model consistency checks to grape status. 



DETAILS - GRAPE: 
BREAKING CHANGE - Grape config has lost the out-of-date --cv / --nocv options. They have been replaced with uv / --nouv options instead. 

Grape clone has learned the \"--allNested\" option, which will clone all nested subprojects without asking for user input. 
Grape config can pass options to grape uv using the [--uvArg=<arg>] flag. 
Grape status has learned the --failIfInconsistent, --failIfMissingPublicBranches, and --failIfOnInconsistentBranches flags. These affect the return code when grape detects missing public branches and inconsistent subproject branches. Grape status will always print a message when detecting these issues regardless of the use of these flags. 
Grape publish now uses grape status --failIfInconsistent as part of its checkForCleanWorkspace step. 
An individual suite can now be tested using grape test. 
grape uv has learned the --allSubmodules and --allNestedSubprojects flags. 

DETAILS - TESTING
TestGrape can now switch back and forth from hiding stdout, allowing easier debugging of failing tests. 
Grape status is now tested using the new grid testing infrastructure.


Fri Feb  6 10:56:22 2015 Benjamin T. Liu
v1.2.6

Tue Jan 13 10:37:32 2015 Peter B. Robinson
v1.2.4

Moved md to first publish step to ensure submodules are up to date, preventing situations where ensure review will fail.


Mon Jan 12 16:03:17 2015 Aaron Fisher
v1.1.10

Adds some machinery for creating grids of unit tests with various grape projects in different states being run through a list of tests wrapped up in a Class.


Mon Jan 12 14:58:21 2015 Peter B. Robinson

Exposes full CLI syntax to the grape menu.

Fri Dec 12 13:35:03 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.1.4

SUMMARY: Fixes several critical issues with nested subprojects and version tagging.  Adds arbitrary cascade definitions for publish policies. 
BREAKING CHANGE: moved .grapeuserconfig location to workspace .git directory. This prevents the accidental removal of .grapeuserconfig with git clean calls. 

DETAILS: 
Fixes an issue where submodules did not get new branches if the user had an active nested subproject. 
Fixed uv bug that could put .grapuserconfig in a bad state and cause requested nested projects to not clone.
Fix branch tagging for squash and cascade commits, respecting branch-specific tag suffixes. 
Adds arbitrary cascade definitions for publish policies.  New grape config syntax is: 
[flow]
publishpolicy = PUBLICBRANCH:cascade->BRANCH1->BRANCH2->...->BRANCHN
Adds cascade commits as a separate publish step.


Tue Dec  9 16:21:19 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.1.3

Removes git basedir call from workspaceDir - git basedir ignores current working directory when git is calling grape runHook. I do not know how this happens, can only observe that it does.


Mon Dec  8 16:12:21 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.1.1

Nested Project bugfixes, adds python version check, changes core subprocess execution in hopes of eliminating hangs in grape hooks.


Wed Dec  3 15:24:08 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.1.0

SUMMARY: This updates the master branch from 1.0.0 to the state of develop 1.0.5.


Wed Dec  3 15:20:22 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.0.5

Addes nested subproject compatibility for grape foreach and grape bundle. Grape publish should now tag nested subprojects.


Fri Nov 21 15:35:46 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.0.4

DEVELOPER: Peter Robinson
REVIEWERS: Ben Liu, Chris White, Aaron Fisher

SUMMARY
NEW FEATURE: grape now can manage nested subprojects. These are nested repositories that are ignore by git and managed entirely by grape. 
Nested Subprojects: 
can be created using grape addSubproject --nested
can be activated using grape uv
are active (cloned, checked out, and managed by grape) only when a user activates them using grape uv. 
are ignored by git (entire directory is added to the outer level .gitignore)
have a branch structure identical to the outer repository. 
are ideal for repositories containing large binary data that you don't want clogging up your source code repository.


Thu Nov  6 16:14:55 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.0.3

Adds nested subprojects as a subproject type, allowing users to add grape managed repos that are ignored by git to a repository.


Tue Oct 21 11:20:38 2014 Benjamin T. Liu
v1.0.2

Prevent error if missing submodule directory does not exist


Fri Oct  3 16:07:46 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.0.1

Changed the behavior of grape checkout to be aware of your submodule branching model.
Switching to a branch with a new submodule triggers a full call to grape uv, starting a dialogue asking the user which submodules she wants. 
Switching to a branch that doesn't have a submodule that was on the previous branch will now trigger a dialogue asking if that user wants to delete the submodule, so long as the submodule is in a clean state.


Wed Sep 24 10:06:18 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v1.0.0

Releasing develop version 0.2.1 as 1.0.


Wed Sep 24 08:53:01 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v0.2.1

DEVELOPER: Peter Robinson
REVIEWERS: Ben Liu, Chris White
SUMMARY: 
Adds the necessary features to enable a gitflow workflow (finally!)
Adds a BSD LICENSE file in preparation for an open source release. 
Updates grape's .grapeconfig to have publish processes for internal releases and external releases. 

DETAILS:
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

grape writeConfig : now has the --gitflow option which will tweak the resulting grapeconfig file to be configured for a gitflow workflow. 

grape bundle : now has the --bundleTags option, which enables branch specific tags to be bundled. 

grape unbundle now takes one file per branch to unbundle. 

grape publish : the --cascade option is now --cascade=<branch> - you must define which branch to cascade to when using this option. 

grape publish and grape review : now have --stashURL and --verifySSL options that enable specifying the URL of your stash repository and disabling SSL checking (not recommended unless absolutely necessary). 

grape publish --quick : now allows --noReview and --public to be used. 

grape mr : now has verbosity controls with -v and --quiet. 


GRAPE CONFIG OPTIONS
[flow] has a new config option, topicDestinationMappings. This overrides where branches are published to. If a topic branch type doesn't have a mapping here, the topicprefixmapping is still used as before to determine the public branch to publish to. 

ISSUES FIXED
Addresses GRP-67,GRP-60, GRP-30 GRP-58, GRP-63, GRP-59
grape checkout now pulls preexisting branches before updating submodules. This should help with submodules' gitlinks being in a dirty state after a fresh checkout. 

grape checkout is now more verbose by default. 

grape config now asks before enabling https credential cacheing.  (this would break Windows git configurations). 

The Tutorial has been updated to instruct new users to use the gitflow configuration by default.
Fri Jun 13 12:19:29 2014 Peter B. Robinson
v0.2.0

SUMMARY OF CHANGES: 
Improved subtree support during publish and addSubproject. 
Allows -v and --user option for grape publish --quick
Allows db to delete the current branch when recursing into submodules. 
Improved documentation and adds a tutorial to the Readme. 
Adds grape push. 
grape checkout more robust to a mixture of branches being and not being present in submodules. 
grape publish now frontloads all user input to before the build step. 
grape --continue and grape --abort are now enforced as mutually exclusive options by the parser. 
quieting some extra output in grape uv and grape bundle.

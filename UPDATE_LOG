v0.2.1

DEVELOPER: Peter Robinson
REVIEWERS: Ben Liu, Chris White
SUMMARY: 
Adds the necessary features to enable a gitflow workflow (finally!)
Adds a BSD LICENSE file in preparation for an open source release. 
Updates grape's .grapeconfig to have publish processes for internal releases and external releases. 

DETAILS:
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

grape writeConfig : now has the --gitflow option which will tweak the resulting grapeconfig file to be configured for a gitflow workflow. 

grape bundle : now has the --bundleTags option, which enables branch specific tags to be bundled. 

grape unbundle now takes one file per branch to unbundle. 

grape publish : the --cascade option is now --cascade=<branch> - you must define which branch to cascade to when using this option. 

grape publish and grape review : now have --stashURL and --verifySSL options that enable specifying the URL of your stash repository and disabling SSL checking (not recommended unless absolutely necessary). 

grape publish --quick : now allows --noReview and --public to be used. 

grape mr : now has verbosity controls with -v and --quiet. 


GRAPE CONFIG OPTIONS
[flow] has a new config option, topicDestinationMappings. This overrides where branches are published to. If a topic branch type doesn't have a mapping here, the topicprefixmapping is still used as before to determine the public branch to publish to. 

ISSUES FIXED
Addresses GRP-67,GRP-60, GRP-30 GRP-58, GRP-63, GRP-59
grape checkout now pulls preexisting branches before updating submodules. This should help with submodules' gitlinks being in a dirty state after a fresh checkout. 

grape checkout is now more verbose by default. 

grape config now asks before enabling https credential cacheing.  (this would break Windows git configurations). 

The Tutorial has been updated to instruct new users to use the gitflow configuration by default.
